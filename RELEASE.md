> **"Your day, remembered. Your data, sovereign."**

## 🌟 What's New in v1.0.0

### 🛡️ 1. Absolute Data Sovereignty & Zero Telemetry
- **Zero Outbound Telemetry:** No analytics SDKs, no Google/Facebook tracking pixels, no telemetry cookies. The app makes **0 outbound network requests on boot**.
- **Native SQLite WAL Engine:** Desktop builds run on native `node:sqlite` (`DatabaseSync`) with Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) for sub-5ms ACID transactions and crash immunity.
- **Hardware Device-Bound Cryptography:** Private notes and sensitive database fields are sealed with authenticated AES-256-GCM encryption derived from your hardware device key.
- **Universal `.lifelog` Snapshots:** 1-click portable database exports and password-protected snapshots compatible across Desktop, Android, and Web.

### ⚡ 2. The 7 Core Pillars of Productivity
1. **Unified Task Agenda:** Multi-block timebox scheduling, hierarchical subtasks, recurrence engine (daily, weekly, monthly nth-weekday), and drag-to-tray unblocking.
2. **Deep Focus Studio:** Pomodoro, Countdown, and Flow stopwatch timers paired with client-side synthesized acoustic bell chimes, strict micro-pause auditing, and active task linkage.
3. **Encrypted Second Brain (Notes):** Full Markdown canvas with dynamic `@tasks`, `#projects`, and `[[notes]]` autocomplete, folder hierarchy, and AES-256 client-side encryption.
4. **Time-Grid Calendar:** Visual 24-hour day, 3-day, and week scheduling. Drag unscheduled tasks into time slots, and drag them back to the top tray anytime if plans change.
5. **Habit Cadence & Streaks:** Daily and weekly target frequencies, automatic projection into Today tasks, and 12-week GitHub-style visual heatmaps.
6. **Honest Daily Log & Circadian Sleep:** Cross-midnight sleep attribution (credits 23:00–07:00 sleep accurately without task fragmentation), energy ratings, and 1-click Markdown daily standups.
7. **Calibrated Productivity Analytics:** Estimate vs. actual task ratio calibration, hourly energy heatmaps, and lag-free executive PDF summary export.
